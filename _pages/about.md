I am Miaochen (Andy) Jin, a Ph.D. candidate (currenly 4th year) in physics at the Laboratory of Particle Physics and Cosmology, Harvard University. I work with Professor Carlos Argüelles-Delgado on neutrino physics. I am also a member of the IceCube Collaboration, a neutrino telescope burried deep under the antarctic ice. 

## What do I do

My own areas of interest spans a heterogeneous subset of physics, ranging from experimental details on PMT triggering to the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations to AI for neutrino detection. My current work of focus is studying charms and hadronization in neutrino detectors, an unexpected combination of strong and weak interactions that I hope to prove to be of significant importance to both fields.

## Who do I collaborate with

I work in the [Professor Carlos Argüelles-Delgado](https://lppc.physics.harvard.edu/people/carlos-argüelles) group at the Laboratory of Cosmology and Particle Physics ([LPPC](https://lppc.physics.harvard.edu)) at Harvard University. We have a brilliant group here that produces great progress in science.
My frequent collaborators include [Professor Ivan Martinez-Soler](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/ivan-j-martinez-soler/) and [Dr. Pablo Fernandez](https://dipc.ehu.eus/en/dipc/people/post-doctoral-researchers/pablo-fernandez-menendez), we have looked intensively at the synergy of measuring oscillations with atmospheric neutrinos across various neutrino telescopes. 
I have learned a lot from [Professor Janet Conrad](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/janet-conrad/) and her group as I started my PhD; [Dr. Nick Kamp](https://lppc.physics.harvard.edu/people/nicholas-kamp) from Janet's group has since then become a postdoctoral fellow in our group, continuing to mentor me.
I have also had the chance to mentor or co-mentor interns in the group, including Tong Zhu and Santiago Giner, both of whom are currently persuing PhD degrees at UC Berkeley.

## What else

I have two adorable cats. I will be posting pictures of them frequently in the Gallery page.
