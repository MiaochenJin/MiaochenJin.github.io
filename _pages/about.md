I am Miaochen (Andy) Jin, a Ph.D. candidate (currenly 4th year) in physics at the Laboratory of Particle Physics and Cosmology, Harvard University. I work with Professor Carlos Arg√ºelles-Delgado on neutrino physics. I am also a member of the IceCube Collaboration, a neutrino telescope burried deep under the antarctic ice. 

## What do I do

My own areas of interest spans a heterogeneous subset of physics, ranging from experimental details on PMT triggering to the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations to AI for neutrino detection. My current work of focus is studying charms and hadronization in neutrino detectors, an unexpected combination of strong and weak interactions that I hope to prove to be of significant importance to both fields.
